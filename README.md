# Bakesale App

The mobile application developed using react native to search, navigate, and get information about each deal from the Bakesale marketplace by creating ajax API requests to fetch the data from bakesaleforgood.com. 

The implementation starts by creating an API request to get the JSON object from https://bakesaleforgood.com/api/deals server and list all deals.

To define a type for the components, we are making use of a runtime type checking library called PropTypes.
```bash
$ npm i prop-types
```

React Developer Tools are used for debugging purposes.
```
$ react-devtools
```
